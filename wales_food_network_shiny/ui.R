This will help identify how to connect actors to enhance transformative capacity, whilst generating a complete picture of Walesâ€™ sustainable food landscape.  There are many small-to-medium enterprises and CSOs in Wales who help to provide nutritious and sustainably produced food. These include producers (community supported agriculture, smallholders, etc.), sellers (farmers markets, local grocery stores, etc) and advocates (health organisations, gardening clubs, etc). These organisations are sometimes referred to as the missing middle.'),

Very often, these organisations have significant financial and political capital, and are organised in such a way that they can respond quickly and effectively to new and difficult challenges. There is also a high degree of overlap of both topical and geographical coverage area by third sector organisations.')
